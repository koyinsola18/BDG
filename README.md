## 📜 Project Summary
High-density cores offer newcomers walkable access to hospitals, immigration services, and universities—but soaring rents push many families into outer suburbs or small towns where those very services disappear.  
We weave *lived experience* with **Statistics Canada Spatial Access Measures** to show:

* Alberta’s rural ADAs are *true* service deserts (indices ≈ 0).
* In Toronto refugee-dominant ADAs cluster downtown and score **2× higher** on post-secondary access than economic-immigrant suburbs.
* Across four CMAs (Montreal, Vancouver, Toronto, Edmonton) access peaks track the **highest rents** (ρ = 0.71).

Our maps, box-plots, and non-parametric tests pinpoint **where** planners should intervene first—before rising costs export today’s urban gaps into tomorrow’s provinces.
