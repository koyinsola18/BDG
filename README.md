## 🎯 Research Question
> **How does the cost–access trade-off shape where different migrant streams can realistically live, study, and thrive in Canada?**

---

## 📜 Project Summary
High-density cores offer newcomers walkable access to hospitals, immigration services, and universities—but soaring rents push many families into outer suburbs or small towns where those very services disappear.  
We weave *lived experience* with **Statistics Canada Spatial Access Measures** to show:

* Alberta’s rural ADAs are *true* service deserts (indices ≈ 0).
* In Toronto refugee-dominant ADAs cluster downtown and score **2× higher** on post-secondary access than economic-immigrant suburbs.
* Across four CMAs (Montreal, Vancouver, Toronto, Edmonton) access peaks track the **highest rents** (ρ = 0.71).

Our maps, box-plots, and non-parametric tests pinpoint **where** planners should intervene first—before rising costs export today’s urban gaps into tomorrow’s provinces.

## 📊 Key Findings
| Figure | Insight |
|--------|---------|
| **Fig A** | **Toronto** – refugee-dominant ADAs cluster downtown; post-secondary index is **2 ×** higher (p = 0.03). |
| **Fig B** | **Alberta** – **93 %** of ADAs score **0.00** for post-secondary → genuine service deserts outside Calgary / Edmonton. |
| **Heat-map** | Across four CMAs, access peaks correlate with the **highest rents** (Spearman ρ = 0.71). |

## 🏛️ Policy Implications  
- **Pin-point the gaps:** Use the index maps to identify the *lowest-scoring ADAs* and make them first-priority investment zones.  
- **Build where people will live:** Extend rapid-transit lines beyond downtown rings **and** co-locate new student / newcomer housing at those upgraded hubs.  
- **Deploy services, not just data:** Partner with **Local Immigration Partnerships (LIPs)** to pilot satellite primary-care clinics and mobile credential-recognition or bridging-programme units in the mapped service deserts.
